This is a Chrome extension to automate YouTube playback with a scripting language.

*Ex-* Script is a scripting language to specify loop playback for HTML5 video tags. The Chrome extension enables the user to write and execute scripts for YouTube videos. Practicing with a metronome is boring. For this reason, the language facilitates practicing different sections of a video according to the loops specified in the script. [Young Guitar Magazine](http://youngguitar.jp/) inspired the development and naming of this extension. They provide demonstration videos with breakdowns of solos and phrases at various speeds. Each exercise begins with an *Ex-*# label.

The Chrome extension popup contains four sections: script, name, editor, and controls.
  1. The script dropdown selects previously saved scripts.
  2. The name text enables the user to name or rename a script.
  3. The editor is a textarea to define the script.
  4. The controls enable the user to run, save, clear, or delete a script and play/pause the video.

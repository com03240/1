This is a Chrome extension to create multiple loops for YouTube videos.

## Intro
Practicing with a metronome is boring. For this reason, this extension facilitates practicing different sections of a video according to a set of defined loops. There are sites, apps, and extensions that allow the user to loop a portion of a YouTube video, or repeat nonstop. The advantage of this extension is that it allows the user to stay within the YouTube site and loop multiple portions of a video automatically. This allows the user to focus on practicing their instrument at various speeds without having to manually restart the video at specific points.

[Young Guitar Magazine](http://youngguitar.jp/) inspired the development and naming of this extension. They provide demonstration videos with breakdowns of solos and phrases at various speeds. Each exercise begins with an *Ex-*# label. 

## Instructions

Click the add button to define a loop. The users fills-out the start and finish time in addition to the number of times to repeat and the playback rate. The checkbox disables a loop.

Buttons:
* play/pause: play or pause the video
* run: run the current set of loops with checked checkboxes
* cancel: cancel the currently running script
* save: save the current script
* add: add a new loop
* remove: remove the current set of loops with checked checkboxes
* check: a menu appears to check or uncheck all loops or invert them
* help: takes the user to this page

Note:
* The user may specify times in the HH:MM:SS, MM:SS, and :SS formats or simply enter the number of seconds.
* The user is unable to edit the loops when the script is running. Cancel the run first in order to edit the loops.
* Save the script so that the defined loops re-appear after closing the popup or navigating away from the page.
* The user is able to reorder the loops by dragging.
* This project started as a scripting language, so that is why the word "script" appears in the name.

## Note
This is a work in progress so your feedback is much appreciated, thank you!
